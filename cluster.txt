Created cluster using below command:

eksctl create cluster
--name ekscluster01 
--version 1.16 
--nodegroup-name eksnodegroup 
--node-type t2.medium 
--nodes 3 
--nodes-min 1 
--nodes-max 4 
--node-ami auto 
--region us-east-2  

Note : I have rebooted the ec2 instance in the end of project completion as it was stuck and due to which the new external IP is changed at the end.
